# Linear Regression with Gemini 

## How to follow along with the Webinar 
- Fork this repo, clone it down locally, and edit the Notebook.ipynb file OR
- Open up a fresh notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- Webinar Recording will be linked Here:  TBD

## Overview 
Simple and multiple linear regression model to understand the variability of advertisment sales using Gemini.  The goal is to allow the AI tool, Gemini, to determine the data exploration, modeling, and evaluation process based on a user prompt.  Understanding prompting and how to leverage AI tools to create technical models is the overall goal of this analysis.  

## Data 
The data is openly avialble on Kaggle (free account sign-up):  [Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thorgodofthunder/tvradionewspaperadvertising/data)

## Initial Prompt 
The initial prompt will be used to provide the AI tool with a task and persona to create the initial step-by-step model process
**"You are an expert data analyst (persona) creating a simple linear regression model to predict sales. Give me a process for coding this in Google Colab.  Return a list of process steps that includes exploring the data, building the model, and evaluating it. (task)"**

## Call to Action (Add the models to your project portfolio) 
- Add exploratory visuals to the README
- After the analysis, create insights from each model and report those in your README
- Prompt for more complex models (XGBoost, Neural Networks, etc.)
